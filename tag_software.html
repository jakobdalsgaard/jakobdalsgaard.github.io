<p>If you build your website using <a href="https://pedestrian.site/">pedestrian.site</a> -- then one of the
benefits of the extremely simple architecture your application has, is that you can move it 
elsehwere extremely easy. It is supposed to be a self-contained Python Django application with
very little requirements on infrastructure. Now, obviously, if you wish to run your application
for many, many thousands of users -- these architectural choices might need a revisit; fixing
that is not too hard though :-)</p>

<h1>Step 1, Create a webapplication</h1>

<p>I created an application with this prompt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Create an application where users can register, login -- then they should put in their home address, 
please do an openstreetmap preview of the location - once done, they should be able to register dogs
passing by their house.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can be seen here: <a href="https://e1e82234-ce2b-4b8b-9a4c-d6312a0ad007.pedestrian.site/">e1e82234-ce2b-4b8b-9a4c-d6312a0ad007.pedestrian.site/</a>.
It's really simple. When you create your own, do test it online, and tell Mistral AI to fix whatever is
not working or just wrong.</p>

<h1>Step 2, Downloading..</h1>

<p>If you log in to pedestrian.site and 'view details' on your application, you will see a button
called 'Download App'. If you click that one, you will receive a zip-file containing your
application. Do that. I did that with my application; please follow these steps to run it from
your laptop (example should work for Mac and Linux):</p>

<pre><code>$ unzip -q Dogs_at_my_House.zip
$ cd Dogs_at_my_House
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, you should edit the <code>settings.py</code> file located in the project subdirectory, in my case <code>dogwatch/settings.py</code> - the following
settings need to change:</p>

<pre><code>HOSTNAME
LOGGING / handlers / file / filename
</code></pre>

<p>Eventually you might consider flipping 'DEBUG' to 'False', as running it with 'True' can expose details about your application
that you would not want to expose. With this, you can run the application by doing:</p>

<pre><code>(venv) $ python3 manage.py runserver
</code></pre>

<h1>Step 3, Further Considerations</h1>

<p>Now, you might want to change certain things to harden this application and provide a more solid infrastructure, this could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using a reverse proxy to handle certificates and thus TLS traffic</li>
<li>Installing a relational database and not use SQLite</li>
<li>Have it run by systemd/launchd</li>
<li>Fronting it with a CDN</li>
</ul>

<p>All this is not hard to do; the Django framework and the community around Django provides plenty of documentation. Your case might
differ ever so slightly from the tutorials, so do not be afraid to reach out.</p>

<h3><a class="ablack" href="running-my-own-mailserver.html">
Running my own Mailserver
</a></h3>
<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #202512280011.59# -->
<div class="subtitle">December 28, 2025 &mdash;

<!-- text begin -->

<p>I've been running my own mailserver for quite a while, years actually, but buying a new domain along with
a server at Hetzner, I needed to do a fresh install. And it's been a while since I did that.</p>

<p>The recent years, my go-to mailserver has been <a href="https://stalw.art/">Stalwart</a> -- it comes with basically 
<em>everything</em> included. Okay, it would be nice if they'd supply Debian packages for a smooth and secure install.
I've never fancied these <code>curl | bash</code> install schemes; but I gave it a go; downloaded the shell script
and executed it. Et voilà - you fire up your browser and access the webui.</p>

<p>Configuring Stalwart for you domain is super simple, head straight to Directory -> Domains -- select 'Create domain' and
enter the domain name. Then it'll actually show you a bunch of DNS records you may add in your
DNS management console, see here:</p>

<p><img src="media/stalwart-domain-setup-resized.png" alt="Stalwart DNS records" title="" /></p>

<p>This page alone removes a lot of complexity in setting up a proper mailserver. For Stalwart to be able to present this information
it has already done quite a bit of tedious work for you; try googling 'dkim install guide' and see where that lands you. And yes, I do change bits
here and there, the SPF record for one, but as a starting point it's really good; and no, none of this 
information is secret, you can look it up online yourself -- well, the parts that I did put out there :-)</p>

<p>My mailserver was flying within minutes -- then I spent several hours not being able to figure our why mails where unable to be sent or received...
Then finally, I found this: <a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/faq/#why-can-i-not-send-any-mails-from-my-server">Hetzner FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why can I not send any mails from my server?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, email spammers and scammers like to use cloud hosting providers. And we at Hetzner naturally want to prevent this. 
That's why we block ports 25 and 465 by default on all cloud servers. This is a very common practice in the cloud hosting industry 
because it prevents abuse. We want to build trust with our new customers before we unblock these mail ports. Once you have been with us 
for a month and paid your first invoice, you can create a limit request to unblock these ports for a valid use case. In your request, 
you can tell us details about your use case. We make decisions on a case-by-case basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aha, once I've been with Hetzner for a month, then they'll <em>consider</em> opening port 25 :-)</p>

<p>It all makes sense, running a mailserver is serious business and I will contact Hetzner in a moth. For now I'll take comfort in knowing that my 
nftables stills are okay :-)</p>

<h3><a class="ablack" href="pedestrian-site.html">
Pedestrian Site

<p>This is a short introduction of the Mistral AI powered Django application builder available at <a href="https://pedestrian.site/">pedestrian.site</a>.
This service aims at building a fully functional Django application given a short description of the requirements. Using the service is fairly simple, head
to the site and login or register:</p>

<p><img src="media/pedestrian-login-resized.png" alt="Frontpage" title="" /></p>

<p>You need to register with a valid email address as you will be sent a validation email; once you have validated your email, you should be able to
login and create applications. You can select 'Create New App', 'My Applications' or 'Support Tickets' -- as can be seen here:</p>

<p><img src="media/pedestrian-dashboard-resized.png" alt="Dashboard" title="" /></p>

<p>Now, when creating an application, you'll be assigned a container in which Mistral attempts to build the application; the web application
running inside this container will be accessible online through a link like this one: <a href="https://9d157f4a-bdee-4f7d-8971-3f28e98ba234.pedestrian.site/">9d157f4a-bdee-4f7d-8971-3f28e98ba234.pedestrian.site</a> 
-- this is the link you see on the details page next
to the application name. </p>

<p><img src="media/pedestrian-app-link.png" alt="Application Link" title="" /></p>

<p>Even if Mistral believes the application generation failed, you might actually have something running. You may continue the conversation
with Mistral at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>Right now the tool does not have integration to any revision system; however, you may download the full application by using the 'Download App' button. Also, there is no
email functionality easily available -- it might come, it might not. You should also be aware that the container assigned to your application is limited in terms of CPU, memory and disk <em>and</em> it will
be paused after 2 weeks -- this'll give me some time to figure out next steps for this service.</p>

Prometheus Amok

<p>Got my new setup with a Linux box as router (an old Dell PowerEdge, but with two
gigabit ports, and it handles gigabit traffic tremendously well, couldn't be
happier).  Besides the Linux box, I now run a managed switch and an Ubiquiti
access point. All this equipment can be monitored in very many ways; but I'd
like the metrics to be gathered in one uniform application, so I installed
<a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> - a time series database to store all sorts
of metrics in; I then put <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> in front of it --
whilst Prometheus has a very nice UI itself, Grafana does come with a lot of
nice features, such as dashboards and alerting.</p>

<h2>The World of Prometheus Exporters</h2>

<h3>Unifi Prometheus Exporter</h3>

<p>To be fetched from here: <a href="http://github.com/mdlayher/unifi">Unifi Scraper</a> — now 
author recommends a docker; I'm more a fan of running my stuff on a real machine. So
I opted for a plain normal install on the box.</p>

<pre><code>export SRCDIR=$PWD
mkdir -p src/github.com/mdlayher
cd src/github.com/mdlayher
git clone https://github.com/mdlayher/unifi_exporter.git
cd unifi_exporter
go get
GOPATH=$SRCDIR go build ./cmd/unifi_exporter
</code></pre>

<p>And voil&aacute; I have the static binary <code>unifi_exporter</code>; copy that one to <code>/usr/local/sbin</code>; then make a
service unit file:</p>

<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Prometheus Unifi Exporter

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/unifi_exporter -config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus-unifi-exporter.yml

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre>

<p>Save that in <code>prometheus-unifi-exporter.service</code>, copy to <code>/etc/systemd/system/</code> and do a <code>systemctl daemon-reload</code>.</p>

<p>The yaml config file can look like this:</p>

<pre><code>listen:
  address: :9130
  metricspath: /metrics
unifi:
  address: https://my.domain.name:9445
  username: PrometheusUnifiExporter
  password: DamnPrometheus
  site:
  insecure: true
  timeout: 5s
</code></pre>

<p>For this go program to accept the Unifi application, I need to install at least a
self signed certificate in Unifi, and Ubiqiti has not made that proces easy. I found
it to work this way:</p>

<p>First create a self signed certificate with your designed hostname as CN:</p>

<pre><code># Make self signed certs
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
</code></pre>

<p>Then convert it to pkcs12 to have something the Unifi java application wants to play with:</p>

<pre><code># pacakge in pkcs12
openssl pkcs12 -export -in cert.pem -inkey key.pem -out unifi.p12 -name unifi  -caname root
</code></pre>

<p>Now update the keystore with this very fine pkcs12 certificate:</p>

<pre><code># use keytool to update keystore
keytool -importkeystore -deststorepass aircontrolenterprise -destkeypass aircontrolenterprise -destkeystore new-keystore -srckeystore unifi.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -srcstorepass temppass -alias ubnt -noprompt
</code></pre>

<p>I believe <code>keytool</code> can come from just about any java you have lying around. Now shut down your Unifi Controller application, take a backup copy of
<code>/usr/lib/unifi/data/keystore</code> file, copy <code>new-keystore</code> to <code>/usr/lib/unifi/data/keystore</code> and start your Unifi Controller again and your Unifi
Controller should be running with a brand new self signed certificate.</p>

<p>Now the prometheus unifi exporter service can be installed by doing <code>systemctl start prometheus-unifi-exporter</code>.</p>

<h3>Openhab Exporter</h3>

<p>I run openhab2, so obviously I needed an exporter for that too -- found this one: https://github.com/baaym/openhab2-prometheus-exporter -- and
it looked fine, installed it in <code>/opt/openhab2-exporter</code> did the relevant gunicorn install:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install python3-gunicorn
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you change line 7 in the python script to reflect your openhab setup, the line looks like this <code>url = urllib.request.urlopen('http://...</code>
-- the address there should match your openhab2 configuration.
Then did a systemctl module file by the name of <code>/etc/systemd/system/openhab2-exporter.service</code> -- with contents:</p>

<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=OpenHAB2 Prometheus exporter
After=openhab2.service

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/opt/openhab2-exporter
ExecStart=/usr/bin/gunicorn3 -w 4 -b 127.0.0.1:9195 openhab2-exporter:app
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Alias=openhab2-exporter.service
</code></pre>

<p>Then <code>sudo systemctl daemon-reload</code> and <code>sudo systemctl start openhab2-exporter</code> -- and adding this configuration to prometheus.yml:</p>

<pre><code>  - job_name: 'openhab2_exporter'
    scrape_interval: 10s
    scheme: http
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - 'localhost:9195'
</code></pre>

<p>A restart of prometheus and it's data is available.</p>

<h3>SNMP Exporter</h3>

<p>Well.. SNMP is not <em>that</em> easy to understand, imho. But this project <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter">Prometheus SNMP Exporter</a>
does a fairly good job of easing the trouble. Got it installed and running. Did a unit file <code>prometheus-snmp-exporter.service</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Prometheus exporter for SNMP-enabled devices
Documentation=https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter
After=network.target

[Service]
User=prometheus
EnvironmentFile=/etc/default/prometheus-snmp-exporter
ExecStart=/usr/bin/prometheus-snmp-exporter $ARGS
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre>

<p>And the obligatory <code>sudo systemctl daemon-reload</code> and <code>sudo systemctl start prometheus-snmp-exporter</code> -- and the prometheus.yml configuration:</p>

<pre><code>  - job_name: 'snmp'
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - openmesh1.lan
        - nanohd1.lan
    metrics_path: /snmp
    params:
      module: [if_mib]
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_target
      - source_labels: [__param_target]
        target_label: instance
      - target_label: __address__
        replacement: 127.0.0.1:9116  # The SNMP exporter's real hostname:port.
</code></pre>

<p>Then, after restarting prometheus, the data is available.</p>

<h1>Grafana</h1>

<p>Please do install grafana <code>sudo apt install grafana</code> -- you'll love it -- add prometheus as data source and be amazed.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.lwks.com/">Lightworks</a> application is a very nice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-linear_editing_system">non-linear video editing system</a> -
and, when 720p is sufficient, free of charge! However, it's a bit picky on import
formats. I've found the easiest approach to this is installing <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html">FFMpeg</a>
and batch converting everything you want to import to mpegts, FullHD, 46kHz stereo.</p>

<p><img src="media/lightworks-redshark.png" alt="Lightworks red shark" title="" /></p>

<p>To do so, I've created a script, should work on all unices, available here: <a href="http://convert-to-lightworks.dalsgaard.net/">convert-to-lightworks</a> 
-- and also a .bat file for Windows lusers, available here: <a href="http://convert-to-lightworks-bat.dalsgaard.net/">convert-to-lightworks.bat</a>.
They should both support just dropping files onto them from a file manager.</p>

<p>To installl ffmpeg on Elementary OS Freya release, do this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo cat "deb http://www.deb-multimedia.org wheezy main" &gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/deb-multimedia.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install deb-multimedia-keyring

Installing MusicIP Mixer on Debian 8.6 64-bit

<p>In order to have automatic music mixing on a Logitech Media Server (former
Slimserver...), now a days you'll need the Music IP Mixer x86 installed. Running 
that beast on a 64-bit Debian 8.6 requires a bit of configuration.</p>

<p>First; make your platform support x86 (32-bit) binaries:</p>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libgcc1:i386
</code></pre>

<p>Now, download the MusicIP software, version 1.8 from the Spicefly Sugarcube homepage:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.spicefly.com/article.php?page=musicip-software">Spicefly MusicIP Software</a>.</p>

<p>I then created a user for the MusicIP software, to keep things separated:</p>

<pre><code>sudo user-add -m --system musicip
</code></pre>

<p>Now, in the software bundle for Linux, there is an init script called <code>mmserver</code> -- 
just copy that one to <code>/etc/init.d</code> make it owned by root, and change the username therein
to <code>musicip</code> and the music home to <code>/home/musicip/MusicMagicMixer/</code> (remember the trailing slash).</p>

<p>You can now start the MusicMagicMixer with:</p>

<pre><code>/etc/init.d/mmserver start
</code></pre>

<p>It prints a wee bit on the terminal, but all is good. On all interfaces MusicMagicMixer is
now responding to port 10002. You can point your browser to it, and you'll have a fine
web UI. You can make it even finer if you download and install the Spicefly Sugarcube MusicIP
replacement UI: <a href="http://www.spicefly.com/article.php?page=musicip-headless-interface">MusicIP Replacement UI</a>.</p>

<p>Please support software, buy your license to Spicefly Sugarcube: <a href="http://www.spicefly.com/licensing/">SugarCube Licensing</a>.</p>
